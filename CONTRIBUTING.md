# Contributing to GitHookDoctor

Thanks for helping! Bug reports with a minimal reproduction are the most valuable contribution.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/6t9xstar/git-hook-doctor.git
cd git-hook-doctor
go build ./...
```

## Adding or changing a rule

1. Add the rule id, severity and description to the rules table in the source.
2. Implement the check and return a clear message plus an actionable fix.
3. Add a failing and a passing case to the tests.
4. Document the rule in the Rules table of `README.md`.

Rules should have a very low false-positive rate. If a check is a heuristic, use `warning` or `info`, never `error`.

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request focused on one change.
- Run `go test ./...` on your machine; CI runs the suite on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased".
